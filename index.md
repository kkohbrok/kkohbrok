## Work and Research

## This website is currently under development.

### Contact and Current Place of Work
Aalto University <br />

### Research Interests
My research revolves around cryptographic security protocols. Concretely, I am interested in bridging the gap between security proofs of composed security protocols and their implementations. So far, I have been working mostly with F\* and the proof approach used in the [miTLS project](https://www.mitls.org/). In the future, I would like to further extend my knowledge in programming languages and formal verification.

### Affiliations
Besides my position at Aalto University, my work is also supported by a grant from Microsoft Research, for which I am very grateful.

### Workshops and Conferences
At the upcoming SKECH workshop in Bertinoro, I will be giving a short talk on how the framework developed by *Brzuska et al.* can be used in conjunction with F\* to combine implementation and security proof of a cryptographic protocol.

### Papers
State-Separating Proofs: A Reduction Methodology for Real-World Protocols <br />
*Chris Brzuska and Antoine Delignat-Lavaud and Konrad Kohbrok and Markulf Kohlweiss* <br />

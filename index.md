### Research Interests
My name is Konrad Kohbrok and I am a PhD Student at the Aalto University in the Institute of Mathematics and Systems Analysis. My research revolves around cryptographic security protocols. Concretely, I am interested in bridging the gap between security proofs of composed security protocols and their implementations.

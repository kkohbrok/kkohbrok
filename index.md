### Research Interests
Together with my advisors [Christopher Brzuska](http://www.chrisbrzuska.de/) and [Markulf Kohlweiss](https://www.cryptulf.com/), I work on bridging the gap between security proofs of composed security protocols and their implementations. So far, I have been working mostly with F\* and the proof approach used in the [miTLS project](https://www.mitls.org/). In the future, I would like to further extend my knowledge in programming languages and formal verification.

### Affiliations
My work is funded by a grant from Microsoft Research, for which I am very grateful.

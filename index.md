## Work and Research

### Current Place of Work
I'm currently working at [Wire](https://wire.com), where I'm helping with the transition to Messaging Layer Security as main protocol and with the adoption of a federated architecture. In my spare cycles, I'm still working on my PhD and following my research interests.

### Research Interests
Together with my advisors [Christopher Brzuska](http://www.chrisbrzuska.de/) and [Markulf Kohlweiss](https://www.cryptulf.com/), I work on bridging the gap between security proofs of composed security protocols and their implementations. I have been working mostly with F\* and the proof approach used in the [miTLS project](https://www.mitls.org/). Currently, I am involved in the [MLS working group](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/mls/about/) at the IETF, where together with other participants from academia and industry, I work on the design of a modern secure messaging protocol that supports large groups.

### Upcoming Events
For anyone interested in the "State-Separated Proofs" framework (see the Paper
below), there is a a workshop ([WoDUP](http://www.chrisbrzuska.de/WoDUP.html))
coming up on the 9th of May. It is conveniently colocated with EuroCrypt!

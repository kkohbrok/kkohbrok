### Research Interests
My research revolves around cryptographic security protocols. Concretely, I am interested in bridging the gap between security proofs of composed security protocols and their implementations. So far, I have been working mostly with F\* and the proof approach used in the [miTLS project](https://www.mitls.org/). In the future, I would like to further extend my knowledge in programming languages and formal verification.
